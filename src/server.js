// You might've wondered.. what does a real GraphQL project look like in practice?
//
// Previously, our server.js file was a couple hundred lines long.
// It did a lot. It's a server. It has all of your schema and resolvers.
// It has all of your data-fetching and business logic.
//
// Now, we moved our schemas and resolvers out into other files and directories.
// Maybe in the future we can add tests alongside them too.
//
// Oddly enough, there aren't default tools to handle merging in a safe way.
// As if this writing, you can't just string concat schemas because they might override each other
// and not merge together properly.
//
// `merge-graphql-schemas` handles this well. There are a few other alternatives too.
