# xoom-graphql-workshop

In this session, we will build a GraphQL server based on the [Movie DB REST API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

### Running on CodeSandbox

[![Edit graphql-server-workshop](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mstuart/xoom-graphql-workshop/tree/01-apollo-server/?fontsize=14)

1. Click the button above to navigate to the CodeSandbox. Fork it to your account by clicking Fork in the top menu.
2. That's it! CodeSandbox features HMR, a console, and a test runner. It's pretty awesome. üòç If you see an error message, don't worry - it's because we haven't built our server yet.

### Branches

If you get stuck at any time, click the sandbox for the exercise you want and fork it.
